Thank you for reading.
### Run this code
Sorry for non-Linux users, but since I haven't added one coded in ps1, this is not runnable via Powershell.

For people who have Git for Windows or WSL, go to the terminal which you are using (mentioned above).

Please do the following in your WSL terminal:

cd /mnt/c/Users/YourName/path_to_your_folder

./main.sh

Or for Git users:

cd C:/Users/YourName/path_to_your_folder

./main.sh

**Please replace YourName and path_to_your_folder with your actual name and folder path.**

## Purpose of files/folders in this repo
bin: used for the purpose of users not having to install Rust and Python
expr: math utilities
main.sh: main shell controller
signup.sh: signup. Will have a backend later.
scripter.sh: interpret() function that interprets a line the same way the shell does.
